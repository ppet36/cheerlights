Sources and models for Cheerlights coaster. Here is schematic + PCB layout files for my build of Cheerlights coaster as well as OpenSCAD model for enclosure and source code for ESP8266.

Build video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22OCCYykrT4

You need ESP8266-01 from eBay, WS2812B RGB digital LED, 3x10K resistor, 2x100n + 2x470u capacitor, 2x4 PINHD connector + standard 5.5/2.1 power conector (male and female) - beware that i made mistake in design schematic/PCB and power connector has -inside and +outside of the plug.

For build in Arduino you need FastLED library; https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED
